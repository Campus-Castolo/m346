    Dear IMAM customer service team,

    We contact you, due to a deciscion we made last year during our annual management meeting. Together we have made the executive desicion that it would be more cost effective, to downscale our on-prem infrastructure and migrate to a cloud-based enviornment.

    Since this is a large scale project for us we have made a bulletlist of what needs to be done:

    • Analyzing the current state of the Doupont Holdings infrastructure.
    • Create a cloud based infrastructure plan based on the old state of the Doupont Holdings infrastructure.
    • Creating the cloud based infrastructure with the nessecary services on it e.g. (Webserver, Applicationserver etc.)
    • Creating a systemdocumentation of the cloud based infrastructure.
    • Creating a Testprotocoll and test the for functionality.
    • Educating our current IT-Staff on the changes made.
    • Support for end of warm-up period (2 Weeks).

    If you are interested in our job offer, kindly get in touch with us within 14 business days. Additionally, we kindly request that you provide us with a quota.

    Upon receiving your quota, we will assess your suitability as a candidate for our organization. We will then inform you of our decision and further details. Regardless of the outcome, we wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
