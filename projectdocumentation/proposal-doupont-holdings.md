    Subject: Request for Cloud Migration Proposal - Doupont Holdings LLC

    Dear IMAM Customer Service Team,

    I trust this message finds you in good health. On behalf of Doupont Holdings LLC, I am writing to you to discuss a significant decision that was made during our annual management meeting last year. As a collective, we have determined that migrating from our current on-premises infrastructure to a cloud-based environment is the most cost-effective solution for our organization.

    Given the substantial nature of this project and our current internal resource constraints due to ongoing projects, we are seeking external assistance. We have compiled a comprehensive list of tasks that must be undertaken:

    1. Evaluate the Current Infrastructure of Doupont Holdings LLC.
    2. Develop a Cloud-Based Infrastructure Plan Based on the Evaluation.
    3. Provide an Initial Cost Estimate (Monthly Expenses).
    4. Maintain Operational Documentation.
    5. Oversee the Implementation of the Project.

    If your organization is interested in collaborating with us on this initiative, we kindly request that you reach out to us within the next 14 business days. Furthermore, we would greatly appreciate it if you could provide us with a detailed proposal, along with a quotation.

    Upon receipt of your proposal, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of your suitability as a potential partner for our organization. Subsequently, we will communicate our decision and share additional details. Regardless of the outcome, we extend our best wishes to you in all your endeavors.

    We appreciate your consideration of our request and eagerly anticipate the possibility of working together.

    Kind Regards,

    Éric Doulmont
