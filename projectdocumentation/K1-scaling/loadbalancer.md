# Loadbalaner

I can create a loadbalancer since I need an AWS Certificate of some sort that I just cannot create because of an error:

![error, this might not display because of the res](../images/error-crt.png)

However I'll still try my best to do it.

This should be my loadbalancer however as you can see I cannot go any further since I cannot create a certificate not even one of my own, since my permission dont allow me to do it.
