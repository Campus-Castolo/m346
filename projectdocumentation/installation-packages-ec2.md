# EC2 Instance packages installation

## Connect to AWS EC2 Instance over SSH

### **Step 1: Locate your .pem or .ppk file**
- First, ensure you have the .pem or .ppk file you previously generated and downloaded. If you can't find it, check your Downloads folder.

### **Step 2: Find the SSH command**

### **Step 3: Open your Terminal**
- Once you have the SSH command, open a Terminal of your choice. You can usually find Terminal on macOS or use a program like PuTTY on Windows.

If you have downloaded the .ppk you must use PuTTy however if you downloaded the .pem file you can just give the relative path in the terminal.

### **Step 4: Navigate to your Downloads folder**
- In the Terminal, navigate to your Downloads folder using the following command:
  ```bash
  cd Downloads
  ```

### **Step 5: Connect to your EC2 Instance**
- Finally, enter the SSH command you obtained earlier. Replace "Valhalla.pem" with the name of your .pem or .ppk file and "ubuntu@ec2-3-88-72-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com" with the appropriate username and public DNS (or IP address) of your EC2 Instance:
  ```bash
  ssh -i "Valhalla.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-88-72-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com
  ```

Press Enter to run the command. You may be prompted to confirm the connection by typing "yes" and then entering your passphrase if you set one during the key pair generation.

You should now be connected to your EC2 Instance over SSH. Make sure to replace "Valhalla.pem" and the EC2 Instance address with your specific key file and instance details.

## Install the necessary packages

### **Step 1 - Install Apache**
Apache is available with the default ubuntu package manager `apt`.
You can install apache by entering the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
```
This command will update the package manager to get the latest packages.

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
This command will download the apache2 package and the `-y` option will accept any additional packages automatically


### **Step 2 - Adjusting the Firewall**

Here you don't need to do anything, because you already have a firewall provided by AWS. This is managed over the security groups. See here [üìÑNetwork Configurations](network-configurations.md#security-group-public-us-east-1)

### **Step 3 - Checking your Web Server**

At the end of the installation process, Ubuntu 20.04 starts Apache. The web server should already be up and running.

Check with the systemd init system to make sure the service is running by typing:

```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

```
‚óè apache2.service - The Apache HTTP Server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/apache2.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2023-10-06 12:42:54 UTC; 17min ago
       Docs: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/
   Main PID: 2560 (apache2)

     CGroup: /system.slice/apache2.service
             ‚îú‚îÄ2560 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
             ‚îú‚îÄ2571 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start
             ‚îî‚îÄ2572 /usr/sbin/apache2 -k start

Oct 06 12:42:54 ip-10-0-0-10 systemd[1]: Started The Apache HTTP Server.
```


As confirmed by this output, the service has started successfully. However, the best way to test this is to request a page from Apache.

You can access the default Apache landing page to confirm that the software is running properly through your IP address. If you do not know your server‚Äôs IP address, you can get it a few different ways from the command line.

Try typing this at your server‚Äôs command prompt:

```
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

when you have your server's IP address, enter it into your browsers search bar:

    http://3.88.72.4

### **Step 4 - Managing the Apache Process**

Now that you have your web server up and running, let‚Äôs go over some basic management commands using `systemctl`.

To stop your web server, type:

    sudo systemctl stop apache2
To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

    sudo systemctl start apache2
To stop and then start the service again, type:

    sudo systemctl restart apache2
If you are simply making configuration changes, Apache can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, use this command:

    sudo systemctl reload apache2
By default, Apache is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, disable this behavior by typing:

    sudo systemctl disable apache2
To re-enable the service to start up at boot, type:

    sudo systemctl enable apache2
Apache should now start automatically when the server boots again.

### **Step 5 - Setting Up Virtual Hosts**

When using the Apache web server, you can use virtual hosts (similar to server blocks in Nginx) to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain from a single server. We will set up a domain called **dhllc**, but you should **replace this with your own domain name**.

Apache on Ubuntu 20.04 has one server block enabled by default that is configured to serve documents from the ``/var/www/html`` directory. While this works well for a single site, it can become unwieldy if you are hosting multiple sites. Instead of modifying ``/var/www/html``, let‚Äôs create a directory structure within ``/var/www`` for a **dhllc** site, leaving ``/var/www/html`` in place as the default directory to be served if a client request doesn‚Äôt match any other sites.

Create the directory for **dhllc** as follows:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/dhllc
```

Next, assign ownership of the directory with the ``$USER`` environment variable:

```bash 
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/dhllc
```

The permissions of your web roots should be correct if you haven‚Äôt modified your umask value, which sets default file permissions. To ensure that your permissions are correct and allow the owner to read, write, and execute the files while granting only read and execute permissions to groups and others, you can input the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/dhllc
```

Next, create a sample `index.html` page using `nano` or a editor of your choice:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/dhllc/index.html
```

Inside, the `index.html` add your html of your liking, for me I used this:

Save and close the file when you are finished by pressing `CTRL + X`.

In order for Apache to serve this content, it‚Äôs necessary to create a virtual host file with the correct directives. Instead of modifying the default configuration file located at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf` directly, let‚Äôs make a new one at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/dhllc.conf`:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/dhllc.conf
```

Paste in the following configuration block, which is similar to the default, but updated for our new directory and domain name:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    ServerName dhllc-web
    ServerAlias www.doupont-holdings
    DocumentRoot /var/www/dhllc
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Notice that we‚Äôve updated the `DocumentRoot` to our new directory and `ServerAdmin` to an email that the **dhllc** site administrator can access. We‚Äôve also added two directives: `ServerName`, which establishes the base domain that should match for this virtual host definition, and `ServerAlias`, which defines further names that should match as if they were the base name.

Save and close the file when you are finished.

Let‚Äôs enable the file with the `a2ensite` tool:

    sudo a2ensite your_domain.conf
Disable the default site defined in 000-default.conf:

    sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
Next, let‚Äôs test for configuration errors:

    sudo apache2ctl configtest
You should receive the following output:

    Output
    Syntax OK
Restart Apache to implement your changes:

sudo systemctl restart apache2
Apache should now be serving your domain name. You can test this by navigating to `http://Server-IP`, where you should see something like this:
