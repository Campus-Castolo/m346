# Who is Doupont Holdings LLC

Doupont Holdings LLC, originally established as Mille-Feuille in Geneva by Frédéric Doupont, began as a humble pastry vendor during the challenging era of the Great Depression. Recognizing the gradual recovery of the stock market, Éric Doupont, Frédéric's astute son, strategically diversified the business into the finance sector, giving rise to Doupont Holdings LLC as a subsidiary of the Mille-Feuille patisserie.

Expanding its presence, Doupont Holdings LLC ventured into the dynamic environment of New York City, where it quickly immersed itself in the vibrant and highly competitive business culture. Under Éric Doupont's skilled leadership as Chairman of Doupont Holdings LLC, the company experienced remarkable growth, evolving from a modest office into one of New York City's most iconic architectural landmarks.

Not forgetting their roots, the refurbished Mille-Feuille patisserie in Geneva stands as a tribute to the once-thriving founder of both Mille-Feuille patisserie and Doupont Holdings LLC. Even to this day, the Mille-Feuille patisserie holds a special place as the heart and symbol of the company at its original street corner.
