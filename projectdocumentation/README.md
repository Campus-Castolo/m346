## Task explaination

As previously articulated, the primary objective of this module is to proficiently strategize and execute a backup solution for an organization based on the given guidelines.

To facilitate this project, I have created a imaginary corportaion specializing in warehouse management and customer-centric solutions.

Within this hypothetical context, I have assumed the role of an external contractor working at tasked with orchestrating the migration of the pre-existing on-premises infrastructure into a cloud-based environment.

This imaginary corporation is a mega corporation that is based in Europe. Their name is OrgInv.

OrgInv is a fictional corporation that originated in Geneva, located in central Europe. OrgInv was established by Frédéric Valmouz in the 1950. Since then they grew by approximately 10'000%. With their numbers now boasting 5000 employees world wide.

In 2022 OrgInv finally decided that they would switch from on-premise solutions to cloud-based solutions, however they are facing a problem. The problem being that they don't have adequate IT-professionals which could do this on their own. So they decided to hire an external contractor.

They contacted the external contractor per email with the following business opportunity:

    Subject: Business proposal migration from on-premise to cloud

    Dear IMAM customer service team,

    We contact you, due to a deciscion we made last year during our annual management meeting. Together we have made the executive desicion that it would be more cost effective, to downscale our on-prem infrastructure and migrate to a cloud-based enviornment.

    Since this is a large scale project for us we have made a bulletlist of what need to be done:

    • Analyzing the current state of the OrgInv Infrastructure
    • Optimizing the OrgInv Infrastructure and creating a plan for the optimized infrastructure.
    • Drafting a cost-estimation
    • The creation of a graphic that allows one to have a high-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
