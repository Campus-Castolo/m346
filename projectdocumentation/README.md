## Task explaination

As previously articulated, the primary objective of this module is to proficiently strategize and execute a cloud-based solution enviornment based on the given guidelines.

To facilitate this project, I have created a imaginary corportaion specializing in warehouse management and customer-centric solutions.

Within this hypothetical context, I have assumed the role of an external contractor working at tasked with orchestrating the migration of the pre-existing on-premises infrastructure into a cloud-based environment.

This imaginary corporation is a mega corporation that is based in Europe. Their name is OrgInv.

OrgInv is a fictional corporation that originated in Geneva, located in central Europe. OrgInv was established by Frédéric Valmouz in the 1950. Since then they grew by approximately 10'000%. With their numbers now boasting 5000 employees world wide.

In 2022 OrgInv finally decided that they would switch from on-premise solutions to cloud-based solutions, however they are facing a problem. The problem being that they don't have adequate IT-professionals which could do this on their own. So they decided to hire an external contractor.

They contacted the external contractor per email with the following business opportunity:

    Sent: Monday, September 4, 2023 10:00:01 AM
    To: customer service, IMAM Institution <customer.service@imam.com>
    Subject: Business proposal migration from on-premise to cloud

    Dear IMAM customer service team,

    We contact you, due to a deciscion we made last year during our annual management meeting. Together we have made the executive desicion that it would be more cost effective, to downscale our on-prem infrastructure and migrate to a cloud-based enviornment.

    Since this is a large scale project for us we have made a bulletlist of what needs to be done:

    • Analyzing the current state of the OrgInv Infrastructure
    • Optimizing the OrgInv Infrastructure and creating a plan for the optimized infrastructure.
    • Drafting a cost-estimation
    • The creation of a graphic that allows one to have a high-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • The Creation of a graphic that allows one to have a deep-level overview over the cloud-based infrastructure.
    • Overseeing and leading the migration process
    • Documenting the migration process in form of a documentation.
    • Educating the inten IT-staff to the new changes
    • Maintaining and monitor the cloud enviornment for the adjustment period (approx. 4 Weeks)

    If you are interested in our job offer, kindly get in touch with us within 14 business days. Additionally, we kindly request that you provide us with a quota.


    Upon receiving your quota, we will assess your suitability as a candidate for our organization. We will then inform you of our decision and further details. Regardless of the outcome, we wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.

    Kind Regards

    Éric Doulmont
    Head of Engineering
    OrgInv Corporation
    Genéve, Rue de Rhône 29

As you can see from this email that Éric Doulmont has sent me I was given a potential job offer, by migrating an existing on premise infrastructure into the cloud.

He also tasked me to create an quota [in ger. Offerte] this means that I have to make a rough estimate of all the cost ± 2500 CHF.
