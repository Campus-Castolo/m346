# Module 1: Global Infrastructure

## Cloud computing definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers.

Some of these providers may differ in services however these providers always include the following services:

| name  | description               |     example             |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
|IaaS   |Infrastructure as a Service|ec2, s3, vpc             |
|PaaS   |Platform as a Service      |AWS-lambda               |
|SaaS   |Software as a Service      |AWS-Workmain(mailservice)|

## Cloud storage

Cloud storage is a service model in which data is stored on remote servers, which are managed by a cloud storage provider. The cloud storage provider is responsible for maintaining the servers and ensuring that the data is accessible to the users.

## Server definition

A server is a computer designed and engineered to handle huge amounts of request and deliver data to another computer over the internet or local network. These servers are made to guarantee high availability by having redundant network and power supply components.

## Why use cloud computing

There are several reasons as to why exactlly you should use cloud computing here are some of them:

* P4P (pay for performance) this means that you only pay for what ever ressources you need for your service.
* Computing power can be adjusted by using a load balancer.
* Faster to add new resources when you need them.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services
* Easier to release application and advertise for them.

## Activity 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

1. Define cloud computing and its impacts.
Cloud computing is a means of delivering/providing computing and application services over the internet. These include storage,databases, networking, analytics and intelligence-over the internet.

2. What is AWS? How does it work?<br>
AWS comes from Amazon and means Amazon Web services, this service of Amazon specialises in Iaas and PaaS.
3. What is Iaas? Paas ? Saas?

    1. IaaS means Infrastructure as a Service this means that you have to manage alot yourslef, including the following: O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications

    2. PaaS means Platform as a Service this means that the cloud service provider provides you with a plattform that can run your stuff meaning data and your applications.

    3. SaaS means Software as a Service

to more clerly visualize this I've linked a graphic in which you can more clearly see how these types differ from eachother:

4. Identify the benefits of cloud computing.<br>
As I mentioned before there are multiple benefits of using cloud computing:

* P4P (pay for performance) only pay for however much computing power you need.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services.
* More cost effective for maintenance and usage
* Lets you scale verticaly and horizontaly
