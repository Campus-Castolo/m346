# Module 1: Global Infrastructure

## Cloud computing definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers.

Some of these providers may differ in services however these providers always include the following services:

| name  | description               |     example             |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
|IaaS   |Infrastructure as a Service|ec2, s3, vpc             |
|PaaS   |Platform as a Service      |AWS-lambda               |
|SaaS   |Software as a Service      |AWS-Workmain(mailservice)|

## Cloud storage

Cloud storage is a service model in which data is stored on remote servers, which are managed by a cloud storage provider. The cloud storage provider is responsible for maintaining the servers and ensuring that the data is accessible to the users.

## Server definition

A server is a computer designed and engineered to handle huge amounts of request and deliver data to another computer over the internet or local network. These servers are made to guarantee high availability by having redundant network and power supply components.

## Why use cloud computing

There are several reasons as to why exactlly you should use cloud computing here are some of them:

* P4P (pay for performance) this means that you only pay for what ever ressources you need for your service.
* Computing power can be adjusted by using a load balancer.
* Faster to add new resources when you need them.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services
* Easier to release application and advertise for them.

## Activity 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

1. Define cloud computing and its impacts.
Cloud computing is a means of delivering/providing computing and application services over the internet. These include storage,databases, networking, analytics and intelligence-over the internet.

2. What is AWS? How does it work?<br>
AWS comes from Amazon and means Amazon Web services, this service of Amazon specialises in Iaas and PaaS.
3. What is Iaas? Paas ? Saas?

    1. IaaS means Infrastructure as a Service this means that you have to manage alot yourslef, including the following: O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications

    2. PaaS means Platform as a Service this means that the cloud service provider provides you with a plattform that can run your stuff meaning data and your applications.

    3. SaaS means Software as a Service

to more clerly visualize this I've linked a graphic in which you can more clearly see how these types differ from eachother:

4. Identify the benefits of cloud computing.<br>
As I mentioned before there are multiple benefits of using cloud computing:

* P4P (pay for performance) only pay for however much computing power you need.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services.
* More cost effective for maintenance and usage
* Lets you scale verticaly and horizontaly based on demand.

## Reflection of Activity 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

* What is one way that cloud computing has impacted society as a whole?<br>
Ever since YouTube was announced the internet has become a place for entertainment and not only work. Cloud computing also allows us to store our data everywhere and retrieve it from everywhere. It also lets society work more efficiently, we are not bound to a place anymore, we can work from home, while on the train or on a plane by using MS Office 365.

* Was any of the information surprising or unexpected?<br>
No not really since it is quite obvious for everyone whos a good judge of character.

* What are some of the sources in which you found your information, and what led you to believe these sources are credible and accurate?<br>
I found my information on statista aswell as some credible sources such as universities that specialise in information technology and psychology.

## Activity 2: Using Cloud Services

So for this activity I must generate a cloud service usage plan for a number of business case studies.
For this I'll use the following buisness case studies:

1. E-Commerce
2. Healthcare Provider
3. Mobile App Startup
4. Financial Institution

Given these business case studies I will pair/match them with the appropriate number of cloud service models.
I'll use the following cloud service models:

1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
4. FaaS (Functions as a Service)

Now starting with the first one E-Commerce

### Cloud service usage plan for E-Commerce
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
    * Implement auto scaling, will prove useful during high demand
    * Set up virutal machines for web hosting, db mgmt. and caching
    * Use IaaS features to ensure data backup and disaster recovery
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
    * Developing a custom e-commerce application using either third party programms like shopify or wix or do it yourself
    * Use PaaS Services for database management, reducing the need for manual configuration
    * Take advantage of automatic horizontal scaling and load balancing offered by the PaaS platform.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
    * Subscribte to SaaS-based email marketing platform for targeted customer communications
    * Utilze SaaS-based customer suppoert system to efficiently handle customer inquiries.
    * Consider using SaaS-based analytics solution to gain insights into user behaviour.
4. **Function as a Service (FaaS)**
    * Implement serverless functions to handle order processing during peak times.
    * Develop event-triggered functions for inventory management and stock replenishment.
    * Use FaaS for automated notifications, such as order status updates and shipping confirmations

Absolutely, let's create cloud service usage plans for the remaining case studies:

### How to identify
To identify each necessity for a business in regards cloud services.
Utlizing this knowledge is crucial in creating a cloud service usage plan, because you need to identify each and every independency and for that you need to know how each service model functions.
