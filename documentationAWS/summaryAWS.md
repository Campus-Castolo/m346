## Cloud computing definition

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”). Companies offering these computing services are called cloud providers.

Some of these providers may differ in services however these providers always include the following services:

| name  | description               |     example             |
|-------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
|IaaS   |Infrastructure as a Service|ec2, s3, vpc             |
|PaaS   |Platform as a Service      |AWS-lambda               |
|SaaS   |Software as a Service      |AWS-Workmain(mailservice)|

## Cloud storage

Cloud storage is a service model in which data is stored on remote servers, which are managed by a cloud storage provider. The cloud storage provider is responsible for maintaining the servers and ensuring that the data is accessible to the users.

## Server definition

A server is a computer designed and engineered to handle huge amounts of request and deliver data to another computer over the internet or local network. These servers are made to guarantee high availability by having redundant network and power supply components.

## Why use cloud computing

There are several reasons as to why exactlly you should use cloud computing here are some of them:

* P4P (pay for performance) this means that you only pay for what ever ressources you need for your service.
* Computing power can be adjusted by using a load balancer.
* Faster to add new resources when you need them.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services
* Easier to release application and advertise for them.

## Technology terminology

### Availability Zone
In a region there are many availability zone, each availability zone has its own data center. Availability zones have the following name convention: «Region»«Availability zones»«edge location»

**NOTE**<br>
Edge locations not always relevant only if CDNS

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
A model in which virtual machines and servers are used for customers to host a wide range of applications and IT services are provided.

### Latency
The delay before a transfer of data begins after the data has been requested.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
A model that provides a virtual platform for customers to create custom software.

### Region
An area where data is stored. Data storage in a Region closest to you us one of the reasons it can be accessed at lightning speed.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
A model that provides applications using the internet that are managed by a third party.

## Activity 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

1. Define cloud computing and its impacts.
Cloud computing is a means of delivering/providing computing and application services over the internet. These include storage,databases, networking, analytics and intelligence-over the internet.

2. What is AWS? How does it work?<br>
AWS comes from Amazon and means Amazon Web services, this service of Amazon specialises in Iaas and PaaS.
3. What is Iaas? Paas ? Saas?

    1. IaaS means Infrastructure as a Service this means that you have to manage alot yourslef, including the following: O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications

    2. PaaS means Platform as a Service this means that the cloud service provider provides you with a plattform that can run your stuff meaning data and your applications.

    3. SaaS means Software as a Service

to more clerly visualize this I've linked a graphic in which you can more clearly see how these types differ from eachother:

4. Identify the benefits of cloud computing.<br>
As I mentioned before there are multiple benefits of using cloud computing:

* P4P (pay for performance) only pay for however much computing power you need.
* Cloud providers maintain, secure and run the computer and facilities for cloud services.
* More cost effective for maintenance and usage
* Lets you scale verticaly and horizontaly based on demand.

## Reflection of Activity 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing

* What is one way that cloud computing has impacted society as a whole?<br>
Ever since YouTube was announced the internet has become a place for entertainment and not only work. Cloud computing also allows us to store our data everywhere and retrieve it from everywhere. It also lets society work more efficiently, we are not bound to a place anymore, we can work from home, while on the train or on a plane by using MS Office 365.

* Was any of the information surprising or unexpected?<br>
No not really since it is quite obvious for everyone whos a good judge of character.

* What are some of the sources in which you found your information, and what led you to believe these sources are credible and accurate?<br>
I found my information on statista aswell as some credible sources such as universities that specialise in information technology and psychology.

## Activity 2: Using Cloud Services

So for this activity I must generate a cloud service usage plan for a number of business case studies.
For this I'll use the following buisness case studies:

1. E-Commerce
2. Healthcare Provider
3. Mobile App Startup
4. Financial Institution

Given these business case studies I will pair/match them with the appropriate number of cloud service models.
I'll use the following cloud service models:

1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)
3. SaaS (Software as a Service)
4. FaaS (Functions as a Service)

Now starting with the first one E-Commerce

### Cloud service usage plan for E-Commerce
